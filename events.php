						Ardeur 2012, the first step taken by the IT Association in order to achieve its motto - Together with a vision towards transformation - was organized on the 3rd of October, 2012. Ardeur, a French word meaning passion, was a set of successful competitions that successfully managed to induce much enthusiasm amongst the students.<br>
						It was divided into three sub-events :<br>
						 <br><span style="font-size:20px;">Minute to win it</span><br>
						This event consisted of a set of very enthusing tasks that had to be executed within sixty seconds and the team with the best time was awarded with useful goodies. A team of two was formed for the activities. Activities included questions on identifying promotional clips of latest technologies as well as tasks like rolling eggs for a certain distance! The event was also witnessed by the Vice President of the Association- Mrs. Nimala K.<br>
						<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Strain your brain</span><br>
						The format of this event was like that of a quiz with several rounds; the questionnaire containing questions from both technical and non-technical domains. The event comprised of three rounds. A team consisting of two members was a pre requisite for the event. The quiz was written, visual and audio in nature i.e the questions were also based on various audio video clips and blurred images and similar challenging questions. The top two winning teams were awarded with useful goodies by the event coordinators.<br>
						<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Gaming event</span><br>

						<br><span style="font-size:25px; font-weight:900;">FUROR 2013</span><br>
						Furor '13, 15th and 16th February, 2013 will always be remembered as IT Association's huge success. As it was a technical event, it was quite challenging. The IT Association worked really hard to organize all the events. A total of five exciting events took place namely: Treasure Hunt, Placement Buzz, Tech a thon, Paper Presentation and Gaming (CS and DOTA). It was a team event and the rules for taking part were quite easy. Each team was supposed to have two members only except for gaming in which each team consisted of five members. One of the most interesting events was Treasure Hunt which required technical knowledge about coding and decoding and the questions were asked based on the programming languages like C, C++ and JAVA. Separate question sets were prepared for each team. The other appealing event was Placement Buzz which was meant for 2nd and 3rd year students. It involved dealing with interview scenario. It had three levels which weren't easy to cross. They were Aptitude and Verbal, Technical knowledge and Personal Interview. The event was quite a successful one.<br><br>
						<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Paper Presentation</span><br>
						Paper Presentation was another event that took place. It was meant for students of all years. They were supposed to send the extract of their presentation at clubteamit@gmail.com. The topics for the paper presentation were: Cyber crime and Forensics Cloud computing 4G technology Green computing Sixth sense technology Digital jewellery Body networks sensors<br><br>
						<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Tech-A-Thon</span><br>
						Tech a thon, an attractive event, basically dealt with web pages and company logos. It too consisted of two levels. The first level was based on awareness and it required the participants to guess the logos which were shown to them in a puzzled manner. The next level involved replication of the shown web page in paint.<br>
						<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Gaming event</span><br>
						The most exciting event and the event which grabbed the attention of all gaming freaks was Gaming. This event got maximum registrations and gave a platform to all the game lovers to show their gaming talent. There were two games CS and DOTA. CS involved four rounds. As it was a knock out event the losing teams were eliminated. First two rounds were race to 11 rounds and last two rounds were race to 15 round. Total 13 teams participated in CS. The other game was DOTA. It was also a knock out event. It involved three rounds and total six teams participated in it. The winners of each event were awarded prizes and were honored. This event was a great success and provided an exposure to both the participants and the organizers. Hopefully, the association will plan and will include many more appealing events in near future.<br><br>

The idea behind keeping this ceremony was very pensive. The teachers were made to play some games to become informal and make merry. They were made to play two games. First one constituted of picking up chits and performing the informal and easy tasks written in them. Everyone was astonished by the huge amount of talent showcased by our endeared faculty. Second game consisted of turning the hands of time and taking the faculty to their childhood days and making them play lemon and spoon race. The winners of the prodigious game were Mrs. Kayal and Mrs. Safa. This was a kick start to Ardeur’13 and was conducted with lots of enthusiasm and entertainment.<br>
